# Flappy

This is a cross-plattform clone of Flappy Bird. This project was inspired by [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno "The Cherno"). I updated his old implementation and added additional features.

### Dependencies
* `LWJGL 3` : Light Weight Java Game Library 3, which you can download [here](http://www.lwjgl.org/download). You'll have to manually add the JAR and native files to your classpath in order to build and run the game.
